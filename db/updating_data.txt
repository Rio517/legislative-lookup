The basic process for updating district data is:
1. Download a shape file with the new data.
2. Use shp2pgsql to convert the shape file to sql which will put it in a temporary table.
3. Run that sql.
4. Run a transaction which copies the needed data from the temp table into the final table and fixes it up.

You basically want to do the same thing as the following migrations, other than creating indices:
20081210181353_create_districts.rb
20081211190903_add_state_legislative_districts.rb
20090313165121_change_dc_congressional_district_to1.rb
20090624155133_update_district_names.rb

If the data has the same schema as the final table, you can obviously skip the temp table.

If all the data has the same format, eg if it's all from census.gov, you can do them all at once like the add_state_legislative_districts migration does. If the different states have different fields, you'll need a customized query for each that copies it to the final table.
