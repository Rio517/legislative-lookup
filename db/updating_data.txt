The basic process for updating district data is:
1. Download a shape file with the new data.
2. Use shp2pgsql to convert the shape file to sql which will put it in a temporary table.
3. Run that sql.
4. Copy and convert the needed data from the temp table into the final table and fix it up.
5. Delete the temp table.

If the data has the same schema as the final table, you can skip the temp table.

If you're updating many states that have the same format, eg if it's all from census.gov, you can do them all at once like the add_state_legislative_districts migration does. If the different states have different fields, you'll need a customized query for each that copies it to the final table.

You basically want to do the same thing as the following migrations, other than creating indices:
20081210181353_create_districts.rb
20081211190903_add_state_legislative_districts.rb
20090313165121_change_dc_congressional_district_to1.rb
20090624155133_update_district_names.rb

Migration 2011007193031_update_state_districts2010.rb has some commented out incomplete code which shows the idea of inserting to a temp table and then copying to the final table.
